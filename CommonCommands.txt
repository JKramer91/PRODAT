Be sure you are located in the "PRODAT"-folder. 

Lexing: 
fslex --unicode ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/ExprLex.fsl 
Or
fslex --unicode ./Assignment<No>/Fun/FunLex.fsl 

Parsing: 
fsyacc --module ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/ExprPar ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/ExprPar.fsy 
Or 
fsyacc --module ./Assignment<No>/Fun/FunPar ./Assignment<No>/Fun/FunPar.fsy 

Interactive mode to parse stuff through cmd:
dotnet fsi -r ./fsharp/FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/Absyn.fs ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/ExprPar.fs ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/ExprLex.fs ./Assignment<Number>/Expr/Parse.fs

When Lexer and Parser files are generated:

Double-check that paths and module names are correct in ExprLex.fs, ExprPar.fs.
If it says "Assignment<Number>/Expr" - Mark it, and delete all occurences.
Then it should work. 

((Temporary until we find a way to fix it))
